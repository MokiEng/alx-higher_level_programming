## Python - Network #0

This README provides a basic guide on how to perform HTTP requests, handle responses, and manage cookies in Python.

### Making an HTTP Request

To make an HTTP request in Python, you can use libraries such as `urllib` or `requests`. Here's an example using `requests`:

```python
import requests

url = "http://example.com"
response = requests.get(url)
data = response.text

print(data)
```

In this example, we use the `requests` library to send a GET request to the specified URL (`http://example.com`). The response is stored in the `response` object, and we can access the response data using `response.text`.

### Handling HTTP Cookies

When working with HTTP cookies, you can use the `http.cookiejar` module to manage cookies. Here's an example:

```python
import urllib.request
import http.cookiejar

url = "http://example.com"
cookie_jar = http.cookiejar.CookieJar()
cookie_handler = urllib.request.HTTPCookieProcessor(cookie_jar)
opener = urllib.request.build_opener(cookie_handler)

response = opener.open(url)

# Access cookies
for cookie in cookie_jar:
    print(cookie.name, cookie.value)
```

In this example, we create a `CookieJar` object from `http.cookiejar` to store cookies. We then create an `HTTPCookieProcessor` and attach it to an opener using `urllib.request.build_opener()`. By opening a URL with the opener, the cookies received in the response are automatically stored in the `cookie_jar` object. You can access and manipulate these cookies as needed.

Remember to install any required libraries using `pip install` before running the code.

This is just a starting point for working with HTTP URLs, making requests, handling responses, and managing cookies in Python. Further exploration and understanding of these concepts will enable you to build more sophisticated network applications.
