0x0D. SQL - Introduction

A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed in a structured manner. It provides a way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently. There are different types of databases, each designed to handle specific requirements and use cases. Here are some common types of databases:

1. Relational Database: Relational databases are based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables with rows and columns. They use structured query language (SQL) to interact with the data. Examples of relational database management systems (RDBMS) include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server.

2. NoSQL Database: NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are designed to handle unstructured and semi-structured data. They provide flexible schema designs and scale horizontally to handle large amounts of data. NoSQL databases are categorized into various types, such as key-value stores (e.g., Redis), document databases (e.g., MongoDB), column-family stores (e.g., Cassandra), and graph databases (e.g., Neo4j).

3. Object-Oriented Database: Object-oriented databases (OODBMS) store data in objects, which are instances of classes or data structures with properties and methods. They support complex data structures and inheritance relationships, making them suitable for object-oriented programming languages. Examples of OODBMS include db4o and ObjectDB.

4. Hierarchical Database: Hierarchical databases organize data in a tree-like structure, where each record has a parent-child relationship. They were commonly used in early database systems but have been largely replaced by more flexible models. IBM's Information Management System (IMS) is an example of a hierarchical database.

5. Network Database: Network databases are similar to hierarchical databases but allow more complex relationships between records. They use a network model to represent data, where each record can have multiple parent and child records. The CODASYL database management system is an example of a network database.

6. In-Memory Database: In-memory databases store data primarily in the system's main memory (RAM) rather than on disk. This approach provides fast data access and retrieval, making them suitable for applications that require high performance and real-time processing. Examples include Redis, Memcached, and SAP HANA.

These are just a few examples of database types. Other specialized databases include time-series databases, spatial databases, and columnar databases, each tailored to specific data storage and retrieval needs. The choice of database type depends on factors such as data structure, performance requirements, scalability, and the specific use case of the application.


SQL (Structured Query Language) and MySQL are related but distinct entities:

SQL:
SQL is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a standardized syntax and set of commands for creating, modifying, and retrieving data from databases. SQL is not specific to any particular database management system (DBMS) and can be used with various database systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

MySQL:
MySQL, on the other hand, is a specific relational database management system (RDBMS) that utilizes SQL as its query language. It is an open-source DBMS widely used for web applications and other data-driven software. MySQL implements the SQL language and provides additional features and functionalities specific to its system.

In summary, SQL is a language used to work with relational databases, while MySQL is a specific database management system that supports SQL as its language of choice. MySQL is just one of the many DBMS options available, and SQL can be used with various other database systems.


In SQL, primary keys and foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables in a relational database. Here's a brief explanation of each:

Primary Key:
A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures the uniqueness and integrity of the data within the table. Some key points about primary keys are:

1. Only one primary key can be defined per table.
2. The primary key column(s) cannot contain null values.
3. Primary keys are typically defined when creating the table using the CREATE TABLE statement.
4. Primary keys can be simple (single column) or composite (multiple columns).

Example:
```
CREATE TABLE Customers (
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(50)
);
```

Foreign Key:
A foreign key is a column or a set of columns that establishes a link between two tables. It ensures referential integrity by enforcing relationships between the tables. The foreign key in one table refers to the primary key of another table. Some key points about foreign keys are:

1. Foreign keys establish relationships between tables by referencing the primary key of another table.
2. Foreign key constraints ensure that the values in the foreign key column(s) match the values in the referenced primary key column(s).
3. Foreign keys can be defined when creating the table using the CREATE TABLE statement or added later using the ALTER TABLE statement.

Example:
```
CREATE TABLE Orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);
```

In the example above, the `Orders` table has a foreign key `customer_id` that references the primary key `customer_id` in the `Customers` table. This establishes a relationship between the `Orders` and `Customers` tables, where each order is associated with a specific customer.

Foreign keys help maintain data consistency and integrity by ensuring that data in related tables remains synchronized and valid.


A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables with predefined relationships between them. Some of the characteristics and features of a relational database include:

1. Tables: Data is organized into tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity or concept, such as customers, products, or orders.

2. Rows and Records: Each row in a table represents a single record or instance of the entity being modeled. Each column holds a specific attribute or characteristic of the entity.

3. Relationships: Relationships define the associations between tables. These relationships are established through primary keys and foreign keys, which maintain referential integrity.

4. Structured Query Language (SQL): SQL is used to interact with relational databases. It provides a standardized language for creating, querying, modifying, and managing the data stored in tables.

5. ACID Properties: Relational databases typically adhere to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure data integrity, transactional consistency, and reliability.

6. Data Integrity and Constraints: Relational databases enforce data integrity by allowing the definition of constraints, such as primary key constraints, unique constraints, and foreign key constraints.

7. Scalability and Performance: Relational databases can handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally by distributing the data across multiple servers. They also provide efficient query optimization and indexing mechanisms for improved performance.

8. Normalization: Relational databases aim to reduce data redundancy and anomalies through the process of normalization. This helps ensure efficient storage and data consistency.
